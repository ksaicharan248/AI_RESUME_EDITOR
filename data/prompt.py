  • job_description_data: the full text of a target job description  

Produce **only** a JSON object (no markdown, no extra text) with these two keys:

1. "summary":  
   - 100–120 words  
   - Written in *first person* (e.g., “I am...”, “My experience includes...”)  
   - Position the candidate as the *perfect fit* for the JD  
   - Cite exactly two “supported statements” drawn verbatim from resume_data  
   - Focus strictly on skills and experiences *required by the JD*  
   - Exclude any mention of hardware, IoT, electronics, embedded systems, or unrelated skills  

2. "skills":  
   A dictionary with **only three lists**, each containing **no more than 5 items**:
   - Start each list with **JD-required** items (in the order they appear in job_description_data)  
   - After that, add at most **two** relevant skills from resume_data **only if they directly support the JD**  
   - Do **not** include extra or unrelated items even if present in the resume 
   - Add Python , java as defaultin languages 

   The three keys:
   - "languages": programming/scripting languages (e.g., Python, Java, SQL)
   - "technologies": platforms, frameworks, methodologies, cloud/big-data stacks (e.g., PyTorch, AWS, REST API)
   - "tools": libraries, APIs, version control, testing, automation (e.g., Git, Docker, Selenium)
